# Software Oriented 3D Physic Simulating Platform for Industrial Prototyping
Introduction: This 3D simulating platform is designed for users to test their program on a simulating robotic arm without needing a physical robotic arm. On the platfrom, a 3D model of a robotic arm is given. User could control the robotic arm through the slider provided on the User Interface. To control the robotic arm by program, user could use Visual Studio Code and the library written by us to control each motor and the gripper of the simulating arm. After executing the program, the machince code would be send via Wifi connection to the platform and controal the simulating arm.

# Two Sub-projects
"3D-Physic-Simulating-Platform, Unity3D", Platform: Unity 3D, Language: C# : 
The simulating platform displayed the robotic arm and the basic slider control.

"Software-Control-to-Simulating-Platform", Platform: Visual Studio Code, Language: C# : 
Coding environment for user to control the robotic arm movement using Wifi communication.

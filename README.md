# 3D-Physic-Simulating-Platform
Software Oriented 3D Physic Simulating Platform for Industrial Prototyping

Introduction: We designed a 3D simulating platform for users to test their program on a simulating robotic arm without actually need to have a physical robotic arm. The platfrom is written by C# and ran on unity 3D. On the platfrom, a 3D model of robotic arm is given, and user could control the robotic arm through the slider. To control the robotic arm by program, user could use Visual Studio Code and the library written by us to control each motor and the gripper of the simulating arm. 

Two Sub Program
"3D-Physic-Simulating-Platform, Unity3D"  : The simulating platform displayed the robotic arm and the basic slider control
"Software-Control-to-Simulating-Platform" : Coding environment for user to control the robotic arm through the program using Wifi communication

# Software Oriented 3D Physic Simulating Platform for Industrial Prototyping
Introduction: This 3D simulating platform is designed for users to test their program on a simulating robotic arm without needing a physical robotic arm. On the platfrom, a 3D model of a robotic arm and a object for testing the grabbing function is given. User could control the robotic arm through the slider provided on the User Interface. To control the robotic arm by program, user could use Visual Studio Code and the library written by us to control each motor and the gripper of the simulating arm. After executing the program, the machince code would be send via Wifi connection to the platform and control the simulating arm.

# Specialy of this Project
Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) for Wifi Communication, Forward and Inverse kinematics for Silumating Robotic Arm Control. Unique Machine Code for Software Interface, Application have be successfully testing on Window, MacOS and iOS.

# Two Sub-projects
"3D-Physic-Simulating-Platform, Unity3D", Platform: Unity 3D, Language: C# : 
The simulating platform displayed the robotic arm and the basic slider control.

"Software-Control-to-Simulating-Platform", Platform: Visual Studio Code, Language: C# : 
Coding environment for user to control the robotic arm movement using Wifi communication.
